2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd veronica`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Configure API keys in `neurons.py`: Replace 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY' and 'YOUR_WOLFRAM_ALPHA_API_KEY' with your actual API keys.
5. Run the application: `python brain.py`

## Installation

Veronica v2.0 requires the following Python packages. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
